# Auswertung Umfrage zu KI von Digital-Vereint

## Setup

This repository is utilizing [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) in conjunction with [renv](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html#using-renv). Having quarto and renv installed run `renv::restore()` to install required packages.


### Feedback
- standardize "Eingabe fÃ¼r Sonstiges und zwar:"
- for sliders, standardize leaving it on 50 without clicking equals NA. -> leaving it on default should be NA
- Q3 should have been mandatory 
- more logical survey path -> if someone did not answer or gave "no" as an answer to Q3, answering other questions realted to using KI should not be allowed
- Q16 and Q4 could have had the same options. this could have allowed a direct comparison in which areas ki is already used vs where people would like to use it
- survey is designed as if KI usage is desirable in any case. there should have been a question or options allowing to specify that someone does not want to use KI at all
- Order effects: open question about what one would like to say to developers should have come before the question allowing specifying values. participants were kind of influenced to use words they saw before.
- there should have been on option to allow specifiying ai competence level
- provide information on poles of sliders



## Ideas 

- Topic analysis or Summary  of answers to open questions with a self hosted LLM
